# MovieQuiz
school project for the web&cloud subject, M1 software engineering students.

A quizz game, generating questions about movies, where the movies are retrieved from the open data of Dbpedia and using the Google cloud platform.

This project is unfortunatelly not done yet, due to technical issues and others odds.
but just like neantic didn't give up yet on pokemon go, we won't give up on this project as well..

may the odds be in our favor..
